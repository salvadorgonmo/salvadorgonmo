- 👋 Hi, I’m Salvador González.
- 👀 I’m interested in Fullstack JavaScript technologies. I am a self thaught person who is really passionate about everything related to web development. The front-end is currently my passion.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript with React and Next JS, a little bit of Java with Kotlin and enhancing my frontend skills with CSS everyday. I am also learning new code best practices and some new patterns. Also, taking a look on enhancing my solving problems with algorythms.
- 💞️ I’m looking for a freelance project to collaborate on, based on JS like React or Next JS. I can work as a Fullstack with Node in the backend side using express or happi.js
